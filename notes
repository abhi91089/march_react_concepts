function component 
    - resuable
    - work in isolation

name should be in capital
1 input called as props
return react elements 

class component 
    - retain data inside the component
    - state which will be object 

can we update state directly ? Yes, but we should not do it this way, because, state value changes but the compoennt doesnt re render 

instead we use the setState method, to ensure we not only change the value of the state but it also re renders the component
